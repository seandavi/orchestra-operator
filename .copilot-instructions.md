# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Orchestra Operator

## Development Workflow

### Always Use Small Commits & PRs
- Feature branch for each operator enhancement
- Separate commits for handlers, resources, CRDs
- Test against live cluster before committing
- Consider backward compatibility

### Operator-Specific Workflow
```
feature/workshop-scaling-handler
feature/persistent-storage-support
fix/cleanup-race-condition
docs/deployment-guide
```

### Kubernetes Development
- Test locally with Kind cluster: `just dev-setup`
- Verify CRD changes don't break existing resources
- Consider operator upgrade scenarios
- Test resource cleanup thoroughly

### Before Operator Changes
1. Ensure cluster is ready: `just cluster-up`
2. Create feature branch
3. Plan handler/resource changes
4. Consider API compatibility

### Quality & Testing
- Run `just quality` (lint, type-check)
- Test with `just integration-test`
- Verify CRD validation works
- Check operator logs for errors

### Multi-Repo Impact
- CRD changes affect API models
- New operator features may need API endpoints
- Consider frontend UI needs for new features
